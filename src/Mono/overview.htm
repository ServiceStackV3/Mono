<h2>Detailed overview of Service Stack</h2>

<p>
	With a primary focus on <strong>simplicity and speed</strong>, ServiceStack allows development of web services code-first, using normal C# objects.
	Using strong-typed DTO's provides a well-defined contract for your web service as well as enabling us to infer a richer intelligence about them,
	allowing the auto-generation of documentation metadata pages, auto-configuration of popular formats (XML,JSON,HTML,CSV,JSV) and endpoints (REST,RPC,SOAP),
	all <strong>without any configuration or code-gen required</strong>.
	All whilst still providing a clean, succinct, strong-typed API, for a friction-free development experience.
</p>

<p>
	From end-to-end it's built using only the fastest open source components available.
	Avoiding all unnecessary overheads where possible, e.g. chosing only to use .NET's raw, lightweight <b>IHttpHandlers</b>.
</p>

<p>
	When the .NET Framework fails to provide efficient implementations in our pipeline, we replace it with our own efficient implementations.
	As done in <strong><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text">ServiceStack.Text</a></strong>
	now maintaining the fastest Text serializers available for .NET - now with JSON, CSV, JSV formats that are over
	<strong><a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/mythz_blog/?p=344">3.6x faster then the fastest JSON serializer in .NET</a></strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Out-of-the-box it's also bundled with libraries to assist the development of high-performance and scalable web services with
	<a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Caching">a multitude of caching options</a>
	as well as the leading <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis">ServiceStack.Redis C# Client</a>
	for <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> - <a href="http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks">The fastest NoSQL DB in the world</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Developed in the modern era, it has first-class support for IOC, testing and convention-based development
	enabling you to to develop your webservices entirely using pure, clean <acronym title="Plain Old CSharp Objects">POCO</acronym>
	DataContract's, decoupled from the endpoint that it is hosted on.
</p>

<p>
	These same <acronym title="Data Tranfer Objects">DTO</acronym>'s can later be shared with any .NET client application
	eliminating the need for any generated code.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Hello">Creating a web service</a></strong>
	 is done by adding a new Request and Response DataContract and the <strong>Service</strong> to handle them.
	With just a single build and no other configuration required, they are immediately discoverable and callable.
</p>

<p>
	Services can run on both
	<b><a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a></b> and the <b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NET/">.NET Framework</a></b>
	and be hosted in either in a stand-alone mode or together with an existing ASP.NET Web Application framework.
	or detached from a web server, inside a Windows Service or Console application.
</p>


<h2>Visualizing ServiceStack</h2>

<img src="detailed-overview.png" alt="Detailed overview of Service Stack" />

<br />
<p>
	The diagram above shows all the custom code needed to host a simple web service in Service Stack.
</p>
<p>
	No other endpoint configurations, mandatory base classes, Operation or Service Contract's are required - your service will just work.<br/>
	It's well suited for SOA webservices development as you get the complete freedom of your Request and
	Response DataContract's to define your web service interface.
	Your <acronym title="Data Transfer Objects">DTO</acronym>'s define everything,
	Service Stack does not add any extra markup to your services - they're just pure DTO's over HTTP.
</p>
<p>
	The endpoint protocols and webservice transport are abstracted away (although still discoverable)
	free-ing you to concentrate on implementing the web service logic against strongly-typed DataContract's.
	If your DataContract's are kept in a dependency-free seperate assembly, they can safely be shared with
	all your .NET service clients (including Silverlight) eliminating the need for any generated code.
</p>

<p>
	The Xml and Json endpoints are efficient lightweight IHttpHandler's that allow your service to be called via REST HTTP GET requests, e.g:
</p>

<dl>
	<dd><a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Examples.Host.Web/ServiceStack/Xml/SyncReply/GetFactorial?ForNumber=2">/Xml/SyncReply/GetFactorial?ForNumber=2</a></dd>
	<dd><a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Examples.Host.Web/ServiceStack/Json/SyncReply/GetFactorial?ForNumber=2">/Json/SyncReply/GetFactorial?ForNumber=2</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>
	A dynamically generated <a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Examples.Host.Web/ServiceStack/Metadata">/Metadata</a> page
	(containing your webservices <a href="http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Examples.Host.Web/ServiceStack/Public/Soap12">WSDL's</a>)
	listing all your web services is also provided to assist service consumers discovering and accessing your services:
